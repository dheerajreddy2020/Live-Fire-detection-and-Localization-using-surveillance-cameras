Looking for a CUDA compiler failed with the following output:
-- The CUDA compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
  No CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER could be found.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CUDACXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER to the full
  path to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
